## Getting Started

"Welcome to the world of Java in VS Code! Here's a quick guide to kickstart your journey into coding Java with Visual Studio Code."

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## How to use it

 1. Open folder `src`
 2. Go to `main.java`
 3. Click `Run`

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
